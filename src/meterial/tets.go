// Breaking down this example:

//     Version: CIDv1
//     Codec: "dag-pb" (DAG Protocol Buffers, a serialization format)
//     Multihash: SHA-256 hash
//     Multibase: Base58btc encoding



// Large Chunks:

//     Advantages: Reduced overhead in terms of metadata and processing time.
//     Disadvantages: Less efficient use of storage space if data varies significantly in size.

// Small Chunks:

//     Advantages: Efficient use of storage space, especially for variable-sized data.
//     Disadvantages: Increased overhead due to a larger number of chunks, which can impact processing time.

// Smart Chunks:

//     Dynamic Chunking: Adaptive algorithms that adjust chunk sizes based on data characteristics.
//     Advantages: Balance between storage efficiency and processing overhead.
//     Disadvantages: Complexity in implementation and potential computational cost
